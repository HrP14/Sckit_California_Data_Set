<h1>🏡 California Housing Linear Regression Project</h1>

This project applies a Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset to predict median house prices based on various neighborhood features.

<h1>📌 Objective</h1>

Predict the MedHouseValue (Median House Value in $100,000s) using features like:

- Median Income

- House Age

- Average Rooms

- Location (Latitude & Longitude), etc.

<h1>🔧 Tools & Libraries Used</h1>

- Python

- Scikit-learn

- Pandas

- Matplotlib & Seaborn

<h1>📊 Model Performance</h1>

- R² Score: 0.5757877060324508

- MSE (Mean Squared Error): 0.5558915986952444

<h1>🧪 Training Steps</h1>

- Loaded the dataset using fetch_california_housing()

- Performed basic EDA (with useful plots - just for fun!)

- Trained a Linear Regression model

- Evaluated it using R² Score and MSE

<h1>🧠 PLOTS SECTION - IN ORDER TO SHOW OFF THE KNOWLEDGE</h1>

1. Distribution of the Target Variable (MedHouseValue)

Helps understand the spread and skew of the price data.

2. Median Income vs Median House Value

Shows one of the strongest positive correlations — richer neighborhoods = pricier homes.

3. Actual vs Predicted Plot

How close our model gets to real values — good for visual accuracy.
